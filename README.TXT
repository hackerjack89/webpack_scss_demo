Just clone the repository and do npm install.
Please install webpack and webpack-dev-server globally.


This is a starter project using scss for stylesheets and typescript for writing javascript.
To run the server after npm install just type the following command:

webpack-dev-server --hot --inline --watch


Above command runs the webpack-dev-server along with hot module swapping(just like livereload, but dosen't refresh the whole page, but only refreshes the changed js.).
